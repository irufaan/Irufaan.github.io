## New Determinations and Goal for 2017 

### Self Introduction

My name is Irufaan Ali, undergraduate student at Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua, Zhejiang Province, China. I am from Maldives. I have been in China for almost 2 years and I am studying bachelor degree on software engineering at the College of Mathematics, Physics and Information Engineering.

 I became interested in software engineering because I asked myself one day, what do I really like to do?  What would I do when I am bored?  And after a while the answer came to me. Software is the closest thing to magic that we’ll see in our lifetimes. We can create entire worlds with their own sets of rules, and in many cases the only practical limitations are those of our own imaginations. That’s a very seductive notion for any creative person with lots of ideas. Every choice I made included taking the hard way. Somewhere in my thinking was a fear of being accused of taking the easy way. My childhood dream was to change the world, but now after becoming "mature", my biggest concern is to find which path I must chose if I want change the world. After lots of research I realized that technology is the key to change the world which is the only way to achieve by learning how to code. Which made me think of software engineering. 
          Therefore, I think Software engineering programs will prepare me to do more than code. Bachelor’s educated software engineers may work at any stage of the software development life cycle. Duties can include eliciting project requirements, writing algorithms, coding, testing, deployment, or maintenance. Professionals who are new to the field often start out as programmers and work their way up to positions of greater responsibilities.  So, for me this major is scientific and mathematical foundation for all careers. Since, I’ll study the scientific and mathematical basis of computer software and learn a variety of programming languages and how to design, analyze and maintain software.
